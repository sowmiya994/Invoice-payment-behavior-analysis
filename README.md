# Invoice-payment-behavior-analysis
**Description**
-This project focuses on analyzing invoice payment behavior across different product categories, years, cities, and payment methods. The goal was to uncover patterns in paid amounts, penalties, delays, and discounts using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries.This analysis helped me identify payment trends, penalty patterns, and discount behaviors across categories and timeframes. 
**Tools**
-Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Skills applied**
-Data cleaning, type conversion, null handling
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Business intelligence storytelling through charts
**Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
-Shape & Structure: Explored dataset dimensions, column names, index, and unique values.
-Data Types: Verified and converted column types for accurate analysis.
-Missing Values: Identified nulls using histograms and filled them using mean/mode strategies.
-Outlier Detection: Used boxplots and histograms to detect outliers. Realistic outliers were retained to preserve business context.
